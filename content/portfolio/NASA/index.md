I vividly remember my interest in Science taking off in the 3rd grade. We started learning about space, and I remember telling people I wanted to be an astronomer when I grew up. I was too scared to get in a rocket and leave my family behind to become an astronaut! My science teacher encouraged me to write a letter to NASA to share my excitement. I'll never forget that they responded and set me several beautiful photographs of the planets in our solar system. Later, I remember logging on to NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day site to continue to look out into space. 

In my first ever full stack application using React, I decided to use NASA's API to make a collection of these images that you could browse through, and catalog your favorites. Check out my application and let me know what you think!
