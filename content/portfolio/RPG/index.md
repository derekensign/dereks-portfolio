After 2 weeks of my General Assembly Software Engineering bootcamp, I put together an RPG game inspired by one of my childhood favorites, Dragon Warrior on NES! It was challenging, a lot of fun, and also encouraging to see what skills I've been able to pick up so far!

Use the link above to demo the app. Use W, A, S, D to move around the map, and use your mouse to attack or use potions, while in battle.
